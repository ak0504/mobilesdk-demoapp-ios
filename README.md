#Pay360 Advanced Payments iOS SDK Demo

Demonstrates how to integrate the [Pay360 Advanced Payments iOS SDK](https://github.com/paypoint/mobilesdk-ios) into your app.

##Quickstart

This project requires [Cocoapods](https://cocoapods.org)

Sign up for an Explorer account at [Pay360 Explorer](https://paymentdeveloperdocs.com/explorer-account/)

Replace the installation id in the info.plist with the Cashier API installation id you are provided with after sign up.

That's it! 

You should now be able to run up the demo app and make test payments.

A set of test cards for MITE (Merchant Integration Test Environment) are available here:
[MITE test cards](https://paymentdeveloperdocs.com/test_card_numbers/)

Payments made through the demo app can be tracked in our MITE [Portal](https://portal.mite.paypoint.net:3443/portal-client/#/en_gb/log_in)

See [SDK repository](https://github.com/) for more detailed usage instructions.
