#PayPoint Advanced Payments iOS SDK Demo

Demonstrates how to integrate the [PayPoint Advanced Payments iOS SDK](https://github.com/paypoint/mobilesdk-ios) into your app.

##Quickstart

This project requires [Cocoapods](https://cocoapods.org)

Register for an account at [PayPoint Explorer](https://developer.paypoint.com/payments/explore/#/register)

Replace the installation id in the info.plist with the installation id in the email response (either Hosted Cashier or Cashier API)

That's it! You should now be able to run up the demo app and make test payments.

Test card numbers can be found [here](https://developer.paypoint.com/payments/docs/#getting_started/test_cards)

To view your transactions, log into the [Portal](https://portal.mite.paypoint.net:3443/portal-client/#/en_gb/log_in)

See [SDK repository](https://github.com/) for more detailed usage instructions.
